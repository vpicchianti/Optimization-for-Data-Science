# Optimization for Data Science 
Repository dedicated to the Quadratic Min Cost Flow Optimization project, implemented using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. 
This project aims to solve complex network flow optimization problems by finding the most cost-effective way to transport goods through a network with quadratic cost functions.
